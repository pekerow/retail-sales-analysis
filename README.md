# Retail Sales Analysis Project

This repository contains the results of a comprehensive analysis of weekly retail sales data from a large chain between 2010 and 2012. The analysis focused on identifying trends related to holidays, macroeconomic factors, and other variables that impact sales performance.
The original dataset was posted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikhail1681/walmart-sales).

## Files Included

- **Retail_Sales_Slide_Deck.pdf**: A visual presentation of the analysis, highlighting the main insights and recommendations.

## Key Insights
- **Black Friday and Christmas** are the most significant drivers of sales, with increases of 45% and 75% above average, respectively.
- **Other holidays** such as Valentineâ€™s Day, Presidents' Day, and Easter have a minimal impact, with sales remaining relatively typical during these periods.
- **Macroeconomic factors** like CPI, fuel prices, and temperature show no significant correlation with weekly sales.

## Purpose
